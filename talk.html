    how to properly serve takeout food
  </h3>
  <p>
    assume you got yourself a nice container full of halal in a plastic bag with a smiley face on it. Before experiencing the joy of consuming food, one must serve it. to optimally serve the food, put a fancy plate under a container, and act completely deadpan.

I ended up asking a kitchenware store named <a href = "https://goo.gl/maps/FBFmwYT1ij1Fe9Pw6"> "Sur La Table" </a>
